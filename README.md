# TemperatureMonitor
Temperature Monitor based with ESP8266 monitorable via Browser on Local Area Network

This Solution permits to build a Temperature Monitor with Alarm, monitorable by every Browser.
The skectch produce a WebPage that use, in case of Internet connection, Bootstrap 4.0 to show the information.

What is needed:

**Hardware:**
  * 1 x NodeMcu Lua ESP8266 ESP-12E DEV KIT 
  * 1 x DHT 11 Sensor Module
  * 1 x Buzzer Module
  * 1 x LED
  * 1 x 220 Ohm Resistor
  * 1 x BreadBoard or a StripBoard or whatelse to connect all the devices
  
  **Software:**
  * Arduino IDE 1.8.5 ([LINK](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software))
